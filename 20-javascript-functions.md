# FUNCTIONS
Functions are reusable procedures

- Functions allow us to write reusable, modular code
- We define a "chunk" of code that we can then execute at a later point.
- We use them ALL THE TIME

First we define a function, and then we run it.

**DEFINE**
```
function funcName(){
  //do something
}
```

**RUN**
```
funcName();  //run once
funcName(); //run again!
```

- Every method is a function

Parameter is a placeholder 
Argument is a value that we are passing to the function

### Return
- Built-in methods return values when we call them. 
- We can store those values

- The return statement is used to return a particular value from the function to the function caller. 
- The function will stop executing when the return statement is called. 
- The return statement should be the last statement in a function because the code after the return statement will be unreachable.
