# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for describing how documents are presented visually - how they are arranged and styled.

## Including Styles
* INLINE STYLES (not a good practice)
* THE `<STYLE> ELEMENT` (not a good practice either)
* EXTERNAL STYLESHEET
    * Write your styles in a .css file
    * include the using a `<link>` in the head of your html document (Recommended)

```<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="example.css" media=”screen” />
</head>
```
