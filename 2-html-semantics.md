# Why use semantic elements?

* The code is easier to read
* It has greater accessibility 
* Lead to more consistent code

Elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` act more or less like `<div>` elements. They group other elements together into page sections. However where a `<div>` tag could contain any type of information, it is easy to identify what sort of information would go in a semantic `<header>` region.
